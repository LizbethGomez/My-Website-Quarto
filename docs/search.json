    "text": "Graduation Shoot @ City Hall\n\n\n\nI am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Drexel University. I completed my doctoral degree at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health in Philadelphia. Under the guidance of Dr. Jane Clougherty, my research focused on evaluating how social and environmental factors impact the efficacy of pharmaceutical treatments. Prior to this, I earned a Master’s in Public Health with a concentration in Environmental Health Science from Mailman School of Public Health and a Bachelor’s of Science from the City College of New York.\nMy research interests are centered around epidemiological and biostatistical methodologies, with a particular focus on disparities in asthma outcomes. These interests originated from my work as a fellow in the Puerto Rico IPE Service Learning Fellowship where I collaborated with a diverse team to develop a community-based participatory and service learning research project in San Juan. Since then, my passion for producing rigorous and reproducible research has continued to grow.\nWhen I’m not engaged in research, I enjoy being a foodie, hosting friends at home, gardening, baking, reading (including fiction), and tinkering with R stuff."
