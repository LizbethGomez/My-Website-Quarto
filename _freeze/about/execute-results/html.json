I completed my doctoral degree at Drexel University's [Dornsife School of Public Health](https://drexel.edu/dornsife/academics/departments/environmental-occupational-health/eoh-student-profiles/) in Philadelphia. Under the guidance of Dr. Jane Clougherty, my research focused on evaluating how social and environmental factors impact the efficacy of pharmaceutical treatments. Prior to this, I earned a Master's in Public Health with a concentration in Environmental Health Science from [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/environmental-health-sciences-ehs) and a Bachelor's of Science from the [City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/).\n\nMy research interests are centered around epidemiological and biostatistics methodologies, with a particular focus on disparities in asthma outcomes. These interests originated from my work as a fellow in the Puerto Rico IPE Service Learning Fellowship where I collaborated with a diverse team to develop a community-based participatory and service learning research project in San Juan. Since then, my passion for producing rigorous and reproducible research has continued to grow.\n\nWhen I'm not engaged in research, I enjoy being a foodie, hosting friends at home, gardening, baking, reading (mostly fiction these days), and tinkering with R stuff.\n",
